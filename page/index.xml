      <description>Public Speaking and Sharing&amp;hellip; I enjoy sharing information on things I learn and do. Listed below are some of my recent presentations on various Technical and Open Source topics. Most presentations need a voice over, since I am big on visuals and keeping slides clutter free. If you have any questions about these topics, or would like me to present them at your office, or a conference, I would be very glad to help out.</description>
