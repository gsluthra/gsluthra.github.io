      <description>My Martin Backpaker Guitar Student: I am giving my first talk in 6 weeks.&#xA;Teacher: Excellent.&#xA;Student: When would you call a presentation a success?&#xA;Teacher: The audience vividly remembers it 3 days after you presented it.&#xA;Student: How can I make this happen?&#xA;Teacher: By telling a compelling story, instead of stating the facts.&#xA;Student: Why is a story important?&#xA;Teacher: Imagine this.

      <description>Turkey (Istanbul) Introduction ThoughtWorks runs an Application Security 101 training for people not very familiar with common security topics. The training curriculum covers topics like Threat Modelling, Same Origin Policy, CSRF, Secret Management, Library Vulnerabilities, STRIDE among many others.&#xA;I was a trainer for one of the recent batches in ThoughtWorks Pune, and in researching some of these topics, I came across many interesting links, videos and information. I decided to write a blog outlining them as a reference for my &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo;.</description>

In specific, topics covered were Phishing, Social Engineering, Cookies and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF).&#xA;As a continuation to the presentation, I felt that writing a blog on it would crystallize the information I had collected and make it available to a larger audience.</description>
