      <description>Your documentation is also the Product Introduction I spent over 8 years on Bahmni, an opensource EMR &amp;amp; hospital system. As part of that work, I was involved in introducing Confluence into the product in 2012. The initial focus was to introduce public-facing documentation for implementing organisations (aka Implementors), to understand how to implement, deploy, configure and support Bahmni.&#xA;Since then Bahmni Wiki documentation has evolved to over a 1000 pages comprising of User Guide, Feature Guide, Implementer Guide, Install Guide, Security Guide, Developer Guide, etc.</description>

      <description>Image courtsey: Friends without borders Bahmni Codebase - Moving out of AngularJS Bahmni, an open source hospital management system and EMR has over 1 Million lines of code (LoC)! Out of that over 164,000 LoC are in AngularJS (Angular 1.x). AngularJS is going to be end-of-life in Dec-2021, with no likely SLAs around fixes after Dec-2021.&#xA;In this article, I would like to shed some light into what parts of Bahmni depend on AngularJS, what parts are already in React; and suggest some steps forward to remove dependence on AngularJS.</description>

      <description>My acoustic guitar - Greg Bennett I have been contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) for over 3 years now, at ThoughtWorks. Many people seem to have some misconceptions about OSS, or don’t fully realise the implications and impact of OSS. In this blog, I have shared a few of my learnings and thoughts on this topic. If you are technologist – who has some familiarity with OSS, then it’s likely that this article will be helpful.</description>
