      <description>About 3 years ago, one of my colleagues in ThoughtWorks, Sam Gibson, suggested I try out f.lux.
f.lux changes the Color temperature of my mac screen in the evening, so that the blue light from the screen is removed, and instead a nice warm set of colors are emitted from the screen. This drastically reduced the strain that I felt on my screen at night. It felt weird, the first 3 or 4 days, when my screen colors changed in the evening.</description>
