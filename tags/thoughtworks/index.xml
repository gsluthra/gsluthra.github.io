      <description>In this blog I introduce a model for helping us articulate unknowns in our knowledge and in projects.
  Beach side in Colombo, Sri Lanka   Introduction to the Model Some months ago, while attending a ThoughtWorks Leadership training program, I encountered a very fascinating awareness model (** It’s inspired from the Johari Window model.

      <description>My Martin Backpaker Guitar   Student: I am giving my first talk in 6 weeks.
Teacher: Excellent.
Student: When would you call a presentation a success?
Teacher: The audience vividly remembers it 3 days after you presented it.
Student: How can I make this happen?
Teacher: By telling a compelling story, instead of stating the facts.
Student: Why is a story important?
Teacher: Imagine this. You are sitting for lunch with your team, and you suddenly remember that one of your colleagues attended the XP conference yesterday.</description>

The training curriculum covers topics like Threat Modelling, Same Origin Policy, CSRF, Secret Management, Library Vulnerabilities, STRIDE among many others.

      <description>My acoustic guitar - Greg Bennett   I have been contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) for over 3 years now, at ThoughtWorks.

If you are technologist – who has some familiarity with OSS, then it’s likely that this article will be helpful.</description>

      <description>Priyank Gupta, a respected ex-ThoughtWorker from the Pune office, wrote an excellent blog series in 2014 titled: Decoding ThoughtWorks Coding Problems.
In this blog he explains what constitutes good code &amp;amp; design, using the now decommissioned Mars Rover problem as an example. His code is in Java. I decided to showcase the same design in Scala, using only &amp;ldquo;the good parts&amp;rdquo; of Scala, with an aim of keeping the solution easy to understand, and enhance.</description>

      <description>ThoughtWorks Tech Radar - Times Square   Quite often experienced folks joining ThoughtWorks have a common set of questions: What should I read to prepare myself for ThoughtWorks? What kind of technologies does ThoughtWorks work on? Will I go on a Ruby or Java or Mobile project?

      <description>Near the Norbulingka Institute, Dharamshala, India   I joined ThoughtWorks, Pune in June 2011. 8 months ago. Previously I had worked with Persistent Systems, IBM Software Labs and Performix (a start-up). I would like to pen down my ThoughtWorks journey so far. Correction. Incredible journey.
For sake of readability, let&amp;rsquo;s list down the things I feel are awesome and different about ThoughtWorks, and why I catch myself wondering why the hell did I not apply to ThoughtWorks earlier.</description>
