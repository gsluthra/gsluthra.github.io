      <description>My Martin Backpaker Guitar Student: I am giving my first talk in 6 weeks.&#xA;Teacher: Excellent.&#xA;Student: When would you call a presentation a success?&#xA;Teacher: The audience vividly remembers it 3 days after you presented it.&#xA;Student: How can I make this happen?&#xA;Teacher: By telling a compelling story, instead of stating the facts.&#xA;Student: Why is a story important?&#xA;Teacher: Imagine this. You are sitting for lunch with your team, and you suddenly remember that one of your colleagues attended the XP conference yesterday.</description>

      <description>Turkey (Istanbul) Introduction ThoughtWorks runs an Application Security 101 training for people not very familiar with common security topics. The training curriculum covers topics like Threat Modelling, Same Origin Policy, CSRF, Secret Management, Library Vulnerabilities, STRIDE among many others.&#xA;I was a trainer for one of the recent batches in ThoughtWorks Pune, and in researching some of these topics, I came across many interesting links, videos and information. I decided to write a blog outlining them as a reference for my &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Near Chinatown street in Singapore Today I experimented with installing ThoughtWorks GoCD Server and agent on a Digital Ocean CentOS droplet. Note that you will need to ensure that you setup swap space on your digital ocean droplet, before proceeding with installing GoCD.&#xA;Read the steps here on my old blog: Installing ThoughtWorks GoCD Server and Agent on Digital Ocean Droplet.</description>

      <description>Near Chinatown street in Singapore I have worked on a couple of projects where we had to make the application multi-country savvy (also called internationalisation or i18n), and I think it would be good to pen down various areas we considered, and the tools we used. Note that, these practices are from the perspective of a Java/Scala project, but can easily be adapted to other platforms too &amp;ndash; since the basic requirements are similar.</description>

      <description>Near the Norbulingka Institute, Dharamshala, India If you have never heard of Vagrant, or are interested in understanding what is Vagrant, then this blog should be useful to you.&#xA;Setting up a development environment for many projects now-a-days isn&amp;rsquo;t a matter of simply running a script or downloading a piece of software. On most projects, the average setup time to get all up and running is usually a day, and sometimes more.</description>

      <description>ThoughtWorks Tech Radar - Times Square Quite often experienced folks joining ThoughtWorks have a common set of questions: What should I read to prepare myself for ThoughtWorks?

But, there certainly are some practices that I feel our in the DNA of ThoughtWorks.</description>

      <description>Near the Norbulingka Institute, Dharamshala, India Note: This has been one of my highest read blog posts ever with over 100,000 views. I am humbled. Thank you!&#xA;For years, automobile companies have utilized &amp;ldquo;Mistake Proofing&amp;rdquo; as a technique for ensuring high quality, high speed manufacturing &amp;ndash; especially in cases of mass scale production. This is also known as Poka-Yoke (in Japanese) and was adopted and formalized as part of the Toyota Production System.</description>
