      <description>Your documentation is also the Product Introduction I spent over 8 years on Bahmni, an opensource EMR &amp;amp; hospital system. As part of that work, I was involved in introducing Confluence into the product in 2012. The initial focus was to introduce public-facing documentation for implementing organisations (aka Implementors), to understand how to implement, deploy, configure and support Bahmni.&#xA;Since then Bahmni Wiki documentation has evolved to over a 1000 pages comprising of User Guide, Feature Guide, Implementer Guide, Install Guide, Security Guide, Developer Guide, etc.</description>

      <description>Image courtsey: Friends without borders Bahmni Codebase - Moving out of AngularJS Bahmni, an open source hospital management system and EMR has over 1 Million lines of code (LoC)! Out of that over 164,000 LoC are in AngularJS (Angular 1.x). AngularJS is going to be end-of-life in Dec-2021, with no likely SLAs around fixes after Dec-2021.&#xA;In this article, I would like to shed some light into what parts of Bahmni depend on AngularJS, what parts are already in React; and suggest some steps forward to remove dependence on AngularJS.</description>

The training curriculum covers topics like Threat Modelling, Same Origin Policy, CSRF, Secret Management, Library Vulnerabilities, STRIDE among many others.&#xA;I was a trainer for one of the recent batches in ThoughtWorks Pune, and in researching some of these topics, I came across many interesting links, videos and information. I decided to write a blog outlining them as a reference for my &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>My acoustic guitar - Greg Bennett I have been contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) for over 3 years now, at ThoughtWorks. Many people seem to have some misconceptions about OSS, or don’t fully realise the implications and impact of OSS. In this blog, I have shared a few of my learnings and thoughts on this topic. If you are technologist – who has some familiarity with OSS, then it’s likely that this article will be helpful.</description>

      <description>About 3 years ago, one of my colleagues in ThoughtWorks, Sam Gibson , suggested I try out f.lux .&#xA;f.lux changes the Color temperature of my mac screen in the evening, so that the blue light from the screen is removed, and instead a nice warm set of colors are emitted from the screen. This drastically reduced the strain that I felt on my screen at night. It felt weird, the first 3 or 4 days, when my screen colors changed in the evening.</description>

His code is in Java.

      <description>Near Chinatown street in Singapore Velocity! It&amp;rsquo;s a term that has potentially confounded, frustrated and perhaps amused Agile practitioners and customers alike at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s a concept that can be quite helpful though, when used accurately as a planning &amp;amp; estimation tool.&#xA;Velocity is a measure of the number of story points delivered in an Iteration. The word delivered here means - dev &amp;amp; test complete, and ready for Production.</description>

And a waste of time.&#xA;A few months ago, I decided to try an experiment while driving to office, about a 30 minute ride each way. The experiment was: Podcasts.&#xA;Turns out, I had uncovered something amazing. Podcasts made me forget the time I spend on the road, and instead opened a window to a world I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed.</description>

Note that, these practices are from the perspective of a Java/Scala project, but can easily be adapted to other platforms too &amp;ndash; since the basic requirements are similar.</description>

      <description>Near the Norbulingka Institute, Dharamshala, India Scala collections provide you three options for sorting: sorted(), sortWith() and sortBy(). Here is a simplified explanation:&#xA;sorted Will sort the list using the natural ordering (based on the implicit Ordering passed)&#xA;sortBy (an attribute) Sort by a given attribute using the attribute&amp;rsquo;s type. e.g. given a list of Person objects, if you want to sort them in ascending order of their age (which is an Int), you could simply say:</description>

In specific, topics covered were Phishing, Social Engineering, Cookies and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF).&#xA;As a continuation to the presentation, I felt that writing a blog on it would crystallize the information I had collected and make it available to a larger audience.</description>

      <description>Near the Norbulingka Institute, Dharamshala, India I joined ThoughtWorks, Pune in June 2011. 8 months ago. Previously I had worked with Persistent Systems, IBM Software Labs and Performix (a start-up). I would like to pen down my ThoughtWorks journey so far. Correction. Incredible journey.&#xA;For sake of readability, let&amp;rsquo;s list down the things I feel are awesome and different about ThoughtWorks, and why I catch myself wondering why the hell did I not apply to ThoughtWorks earlier.</description>
